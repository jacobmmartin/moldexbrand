Quaternary ammonium chlorides, or “quats,” are noncorrosive, making them gentler on  equipment and surfaces.  Bleach (active ingredient Sodium Hypochloride) is very effective in removing the discoloration caused by mold, but may leave the microflora that enables the mold to grow.</p><br><h6>Does Moldex<span class=\"sup\">®</span> Mold Killer remove mold stains? </h6><p><strong>Yes &amp; No. </strong>Mold &amp; Mildew, if left untreated, can result in deeply embedded ugly black mold stains.  In some cases, it will remove the stain. In other cases, a more aggressive stain remover will be required. Moldex<span class=\"sup\">®</span> Mold Killer is a great cleaner that delivers non-acid cleaning performance.  It removes   dirt, grease, grime, food stains, soap scum, fingerprints,  crayon / pencil marks and heel marks, but it does NOT contain bleach or whitening agents. If difficult mold stains are present, we recommend using one of our stain removers.
